Nature of Code / openFrameworks
===============================
Concepts and ideas from Daniel Shiffman's amazing book, written in openFrameworks.

[Buy the book](http://natureofcode.com/) or [read it online](http://natureofcode.com/).

Is this repo a port of the examples to oF?
------------------------------------------
Not really. Shiffman has made available [code examples for each chapter](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples), written in Processing. A [couple of people](https://github.com/firmread/NatureOfCode) have made [partial ports](https://github.com/emmanuelgeoffray/The-Nature-of-Code) of that repo to openFrameworks.

This repo isn't another port, though in some ways it's similar.

What is it then?
----------------
This repo is my response to reading the book - study notes and experiments. It's just that I published my scrapbook in case it helps anyone.

How to use this repo
--------------------
At the root there is a .java file for each chapter in the book, with what I thought were the salient points worth noting down and playing with.

openFrameworks forces you to use a certain directory structure, so I just included the entire openFrameworks 0.8.3 distribution. You should be able to easily clone the repo and launch the examples, if you own a Mac with Xcode anyway.

To see the oF code, navigate to [of083/apps/experiments](https://github.com/microcosm/natureOfCode/tree/master/of083/apps/experiments), or just use the 'experiments' symlink to jump straight in there.
